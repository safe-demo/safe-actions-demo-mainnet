# Safe GitHub Actions Template

This template repository can be forked to easily setup monitoring for a Safe via GitHub actions.

The template includes the use of the following GitHub actions:

- [Safe Transaction Simulator](https://github.com/rmeissner/safe-simulator-gh-action/blob/main/action.yml)
  - This GitHub action will Simulate Multisig, Module and SafeSnap transactions
- [Safe Service Monitor](https://github.com/rmeissner/safe-service-monitor-gh-action/blob/main/action.yml)
  - This GitHub will monitor the Safe service for new pending transactions


### Set up

The following secrets should be set on your GitHub repository:

- `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - [GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), used to trigger sub flows
- `TARGET_SAFE` - Checksummed address of the Safe to monitor
- `JSON_RPC_NODE` - Ethereum JSON RPC endpoint (e.g. [Infura](https://infura.io/dashboard))
- `SERVICE_URL` - URL of the Safe service to monitor (defaults to `https://safe-transaction.mainnet.gnosis.io/`)


### Workflows

#### monitor.yml

This workflow configures the [Safe Service Monitor](https://github.com/rmeissner/safe-service-monitor-gh-action/blob/main/action.yml) action. It is setup to check every 5 minutes if a new pending multisig transaction is available and create a new PR with the details of that multisig transaction.

#### simulator.yml

This workflow configures the [Safe Transaction Simulator](https://github.com/rmeissner/safe-simulator-gh-action/blob/main/action.yml) action. It is setup to check run a simulation for each `push` to a branch that is not to `main` (assumed to be the deault branch).
